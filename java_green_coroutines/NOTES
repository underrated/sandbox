I tried to implement coroutines in java using a trick that was used in C and C++ and which involves the use of a switch statement.

The C/C++ tricks are documented here:

Unfortunately we can't apply the trick in Java...at least not as elegant as in C/C++.
That is because, in Java, you are not allowed to use case statements inside if/while/for{} blocks because they will be considered as being outside of the switch block and be considered "orphaned case statements".
Control statements are still possible but some really weird manipulations need to be done and the final code will look more like assembly than Java. Life is life...you can't have a cake and eat it too.
